# MyRulesZigFmt
Hands off my code Ziglang!  You claim to be above stupid symantic debates, but then enforce aribitrary rules that many don't like.  Consistency is in style always will be project dependent, enforcing spaces won't change that.  Different naming standards, file structure, and general design will always differentiate code from different projects.
